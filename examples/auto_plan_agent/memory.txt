{"role":"system","content":"Morning: Start with breakfast to fuel up for the day. \n\n Mid-morning to Afternoon: Head to the company, then arrange meetings with clients as needed. I’ll keep an eye on the clock to ensure everything wraps up in time. \n\n 5:00 pm: Pick up Tom from school. \n\n Evening: End the day by taking a picture with Tom to share with Lily, so she sees her two favorite guys together. This should keep the day smooth and still make time for a special moment with Tom at the end!"}
